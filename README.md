#### Distance effect on two-number comparison tests
#### Measuring RTs for number comparison

The experiment presents a random number between 1 and 99, and asks the subject to decide wether the presented number is smaller or larger than 55. We then plot the reactions times as a function of the number.

Do you replicate the distance effect reported by Dehaene, S., Dupoux, E., & Mehler, J. (1990) in “Is numerical comparison digital? Analogical and symbolic effects in two-digit number comparison.” Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 16, 626–641.?
