Dehaene et al.,1990 : Experiment 1
-----------------------------------
* Git Hub page:https://github.com/kvanvoor/PCBS_Project

The aim of our project was to produce a replication of Experiment 1 from Dehaene et al.,1990 as close as possible to the original paradigm. See [here](https://github.com/kvanvoor/PCBS_Project/blob/main/Dehaene%20et%20al.%20-%201990%20-%20Is%20numerical%20comparison%20digital%20Analogical%20and%20sy.pdf) for reference.

The experiment consists of a practice session and experimental session in which the participant is presented a number between 11 and 100, except the standard 55, and asked to determine whether it is greater than or less than 55. They are instructed to respond by pressing the 'f' or 'j' keys for 'less than' and 'greater than' respectively.

The stimuli were two pseudo-randomized lists which we created using R and manually implementing the paramters that were outline ins Dehaene et al. (1990), namely:
  * there were not three consecutive numbers greater than 55 or less than 55 presented.
  * there were never two of the same numbers presented consecutively,

Every number was presented 2 times, except those between 41 and 69, which were presented 4 times. 

As in Dehaene et al. (1990), we were concerend with measuring the response times of the participant during each trial.
