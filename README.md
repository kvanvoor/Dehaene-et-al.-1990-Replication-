Dehaene et al.,1990 : Experiment 1
-----------------------------------
*Git Hub page:https://github.com/kvanvoor/PCBS_Project

The aim of our project was to produce a replication of Experiment 1 from Dehaene et al.,1990 as close as possible to the original design. See [here](https://github.com/kvanvoor/PCBS_Project/blob/main/Dehaene%20et%20al.%20-%201990%20-%20Is%20numerical%20comparison%20digital%20Analogical%20and%20sy.pdf) for reference.

The experiment presents a random number between 1 and 99, and asks the subject to decide wether the presented number is smaller or larger than 55. We then plot the reactions times as a function of the number.

Do you replicate the distance effect reported by Dehaene, S., Dupoux, E., & Mehler, J. (1990) in “Is numerical comparison digital? Analogical and symbolic effects in two-digit number comparison.” Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 16, 626–641.?
